# IPL Social - Password Checker with DevOps Pipeline

## Project Description
This project is a demonstration of a **PasswordChecker** class implemented in JavaScript. The class validates passwords based on the following criteria:
1. The password must contain **at least 8 characters**.
2. The password must include **at least one special character**.
3. The password must include **at least one digit**.
4. The password must **not contain the substring "IPL"** (case-insensitive).

Additionally, the project includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests using Jest to ensure all validation rules are covered, including edge cases.
- **DevOps Pipeline**: A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on pull requests.
